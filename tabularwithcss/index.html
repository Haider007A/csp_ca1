    <h1>Pakistan</h1>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    <p id="1"><strong>Pakistan</strong>,[c] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,<sup>[d]</sup> is a country in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"> South Asia</a>. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a population of almost 227 million, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.

        Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan,<sup>[13]</sup> and the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World"> Old World</a>.<sup>[14][15]</sup> The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Alexander_the_Great"> Alexander the Great</a>; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;<sup>[16]</sup> the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahi, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,<sup>[17]</sup> the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East India Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947.</p>

        <strong>Early and medieval age</strong>
        <p id="2"> Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan.<sup>[34]</sup> The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom stone tools have been found in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soan_Valley"> Soan Valley</a> of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan"> Punjab</a>.<sup>[35]</sup> The Indus region, which covers most of present day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh<sup>[36]</sup> and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation<sup>[37][38]</sup> (2,800–1,800 BCE) at Harappa and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-Daro"> Mohenjo-Daro</a>.<sup>[39]</sup> of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan.<sup>[34]</sup> The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom stone tools have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab.<sup>[35]</sup> The Indus region, which covers most of present day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh<sup>[36]</sup> and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation<sup>[37][38]</sup> (2,800–1,800 BCE) at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.<sup>[39]</sup></p>

        <strong>Islamic conquest</strong>
        <p id="3"> The Arab conqueror<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Qasim"> Muhammad bin Qasim</a> conquered Sindh in 711 CE.<sup>[49][50]</sup> The Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid<sup>[49][51]</sup> but the concept of Pakistan arrived in the 19th century. The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"> Islam</a> in the region. During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam.<sup>[52]</sup> Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley, Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_in_the_Indian_subcontinent"> several successive Muslim empires</a> ruled over the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).</p>
